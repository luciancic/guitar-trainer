# Guitar Trainer

A collection of helper exercices for my guitar practice.

## How to use

Copy the code of the desired exercice in the browser console. I will build an UI for them after getting ahead in my other projects. Look forward to it!

## Exercices

This is a list of the exercices so far:

* Single note
* Single arpeggio
* Single chord
* Chord progression
* Arpeggio progression
* Pentatonic scale progression

### Single note

Find and play the randomly generated note within the designated frets. Find all the notes in that area, alternating from highest to lowest, for maximum fretboard familiarity.

### Single arpeggio

Play the arpeggio in the designated scale up and down the fretboard. Try playing the notes/shapes in different order for maximum flexibility on the fretboard.

### Single chord

Play the designated chord in all positions up and down the neck. Alternate shapes in different orders to improve your sense of distance between shapes.

### Chord progression

Play the chord progression in the designated key. Internalize the feel of the cords and the direction they pull to improve musical intuition.

### Arpeggio progression

Similar to the chord progression, alternate the arpeggios in the provided key all over the neck.

### Pentatonic scale progression

Play the progression in pentatonic scale in the designated key. Be sure to let the color of the chord changes shine through.
