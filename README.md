My personal collection of guitar exercise helpers.

## Exercices

3 exercices are currently available:

- Single Note
- Single Scale
- Progression

### Single note

Find and play the randomly generated note within the designated frets. Find all the notes in that area, alternating from highest to lowest, for maximum fretboard familiarity.

### Single scale

Play the scale in the designated key up and down the fretboard. You can play it as a chord in all shapes, as an arpeggio, or as a scale (pentatonic or full). Try playing the notes/shapes in different order for maximum flexibility on the fretboard.

### Chord progression

Play the progression in the designated key. Play them as chords, arpeggios or scales. Internalize the feel of the music and the direction they pull to improve musical intuition.
